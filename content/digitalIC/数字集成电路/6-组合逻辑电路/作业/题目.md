1. Analysis of propagation delay of combination circuit

   ![题目一](images/题目一.png)

   - Assume each input is driven by an inverter with size=1, and the output load is an inverter with size=120, which one has the minimum delay? (from input of inverter to the output of AND8)
   - Provided the probability that each input node is 1 is 0.25, which one has the smallest energy?
   - Provided input slope should be considered and $t^i_p=t^i_{\rm step}+0.2t^{i-1}_{\rm step}$, determine the size of (a) to minimize propagation delay.
   - Use cascading dynamic logic to implement this logic function. Can propagation delay can be reduced? Give your opinion.

2. Given a logic function  $Y=  \overline{((A+B)C)}$  

   - Design a circuit to realize above logic function with CMOS static logic and dynamic logic individually.
   - Compute logical effort per signal input and intrinsic delay for circuits in 1). Pay attentions that $p_{LH}$, $p_{HL}$, $g_{HL}$ and $g_{LH}$ are not necessary the same.
   - Calculate the worst tp with elmore delay formula.
